# Grapheme to Phoneme (G2P)

This is the implementation for [Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Net Models for
Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00196.pdf) based on Pytorch.

It's motivated by [cmusphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/g2p-seq2seq) and data is from [cmudict](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict).
